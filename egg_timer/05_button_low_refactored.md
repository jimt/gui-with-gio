# Chapter 5 - Low button refactored

## Goals
The intention of this section is to organize the code better. 

## Outline

Up to now, we've built the program by bolting on functionality, bit by bit. And it has served us well. But having all the code inside one big ```main()``` is starting to become a little unwieldy. Hence we'll refactor the program a bit, simply breaking it up into smaller pieces. 
 
> Transforming code in a safe and rapid way is vital to keeping it cheap and easy to modify for future needs. 
Well said [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html)
