# Bonus material - Animation

## Goals
The intention of this section is to discuss a slightly more advanced topic related to animation, namely how and when we invalidate a frame, what that actually means, and how to code well with it.

 - Finally

```go

```

## Comments

What's happening here, and why does it matter
